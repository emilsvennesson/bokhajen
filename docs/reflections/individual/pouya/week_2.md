# Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
My goals are still very similar to last week, but also working with user stories. This week I've been learning much about user stories theoretically, but I would like to be able to work with them flawlessly. To be able to do that, I'd have to use what I've learnt in the project.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As I've been working with vertical slicing user stories most of the week, I believe that I can help with understanding how one would work with user stories and slicing it vertically. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contributions has been working with the scrumboard.
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've been helping with my team's deliveries whenever they needed help, like defining their tasks, providing them with tools that helps them to accomplish their deliveries in a more smooth and manageable process.
