# Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
For this current week, I would like to grasp the basics of javascript and react. Since this is the primary tool and language we use for the application, it would be wise to know it. To do this, I might have to spend some time learning in my free time.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now since nobody in the team is proficient in React, we'll have to work together and use our collective knowledge to work towards our goal. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contribution towards the team's use of Scrum has been partaking in scrumboards and partly documenting meeting protocols.
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been working with a user story.
