# Week 8

This is probably a repeat of last week, as the last two weeks has been very similar

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I feel pretty content with having to learn or understand anything.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'm not sure if I can help my team learn something new at this point.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've been actively participating in Scrum meetings and communicated with the group
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My contribution this week has been finishing all of my assigned user stories.
