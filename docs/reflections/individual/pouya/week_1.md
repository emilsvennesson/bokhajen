# Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
There is a lot of things I would like to learn from this project and understand better. Specifically scrum, but also working in a larger team. Currently, I know the basics of scrum in theory but I can't exactly describe the process in detail. I would like to be at a level where I can apply the fundamental's of scrum in practice. For this to happen, I have to follow the course and its lectures, whilst applying what I've learnt to the project.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that I can help by sharing resources that I think will benefit the team and the project. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As my knowledge of Scrum is pretty low, I haven't contributed much to the team's use of Scrum. I have been discussing some basic principles of Scrum with the team, which hopefully has increased our knowledge of the subject.
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've been contributing with ideas, discussed work flow and planning how we are going to set up the coming weeks.
