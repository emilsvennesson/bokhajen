# Week 5

Apparently I did not upload week 5's document and I lost it when I replaced week 5s file with week 6. Although with CTRL+Z i managed to get back some of the text, but not all of it.

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

It's not much about learning something new, but more about not straying from what we've learnt. Sometimes you overthink and forget the intended purpose, thus forgetting what we were told in the initial phase of the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been discussing with the team about revisiting the scrumboard. I felt like we didn't have full coverage of tasks for the project. Multiple user stories were missing, which meant that we could not progress further with the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been working with the user stories and finishing tasks.
