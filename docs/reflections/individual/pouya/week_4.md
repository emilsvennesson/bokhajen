# Week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Javascript and React is probably the team's major obstacles. We're all learning as we're progressing. We've all been taking on different tasks, requiring different knowledges. I would like to learn and understand what my teammates are doing so I can become a better developer. To accomplish this, I need to take time to read their commits and code 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As of now, I'm not sure if I can help the team learn something new. Although I do think I am able to help the  the team in anything regarding the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week has been pretty similar to previous week. Contribution being towards the team's use of Scrum has been partaking in scrumboards and partly documenting meeting protocols.
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been working with defining the project and finishing tasks.
