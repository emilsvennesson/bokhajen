# Week 6

This week has probably been the most efficient week so far. The rest of the team agrees. We've been reworking our tasks and user stories to fit our goals more and I think this is the biggest reason to why we've been working so well and been completing our tasks at an incredible rate. 

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I've started to understand the pros of scrum. Once we had our scrumboard reworked on and polished, we could feel the smooth sailing to our goals. I'd like to keep understanding more of Scrum so I can fully understand it without relying on external information. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think last week's topic is still relevant;

So far, I believe the main priority is not straying from what we've learnt. Sometimes you overthink and forget the intended purpose, thus forgetting what we were told in the initial phase of the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've been a part of reworking the the scrumboard.
##  What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have been finishing user stories and tasks.
