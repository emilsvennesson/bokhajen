What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have now been introduced to the scrum framework and how it is used in theory. 
I want to understand how concepts like INVEST & SMART criterias, user stories and tasks can be used in practice, 
so that scrum is used correctly and efficiently. I also want to learn how to use figma as a design tool.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By being present and involved in our team meetings, I hope to help the team or someone in the team to learn something new. 


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have participated in planning meetings on how we as a team can use scrum together in the upcoming sprint.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Together with Hampus, I have developed a business model for our upcoming website using the business model canvas.
