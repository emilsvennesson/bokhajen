What do I want to learn or understand better? 

I would like to learn more about scrum and to see how it can be implemented in practice in an effective way for a project.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

I think we have a lot to learn from each other. We are 8 people with partly completely different experiences and skills. From my side, as well as the other group members, it is important that we share the knowledge and experience we have and, above all, create during the course.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum? 

At this stage, I can help by being well versed in the framework. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

That I complete the assignments given to me by the group within a set timeframe.
