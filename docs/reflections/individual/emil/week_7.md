# Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

I think we all are getting more and more comfortable with working in an agile enviroment and I think and our scrumboard reflects that. It now feels a lot more useful to look at during the development process.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

This is the same as all the other previous weeks really, and I have nothing new to say here.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been writing user stories, taking part in our weekly meetings and estimating effort together with the rest of the group.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have finished the user stories that have been assigned to me.
