# Week 8

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

It feels like I have got the hang of scrum now, which obviously is good considering that this is the final week. There is still more to learn though, and I guess you're never really fulle learned.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I feel like I've answered this so many times now and there is really nothing new to say.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've contributed to the scrumboard.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have finished my assigned user stories.
