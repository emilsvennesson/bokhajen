# Week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

We've decided to use Firebase for our backend, and there's a lot for me to learn there seeing as I've never used it before.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will show how the Firebase authentication and storage is implemented once we have got it set up and running in our codebase.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been working on the user stories and taking parts in the meetings.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've been working together with Elias on the user stories related to the backend.
