# Week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

We are all still struggling a bit with the user stories. It feels like we keep having to remake/create new ones because the ones we had were not defined well enough. The same goes for approximating velocity which is a struggle every week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By sitting together when we are writing code - to me that's the best way to teach out things I've learned to the others as well as getting to know new things at the same time.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I've been contributing to the scrum board as well as taking part in the weekly reflection.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've been working with my assigned user stories. We had a lot to do in our other course this week so unforunately I wasn't able to finish them all during this sprint.
