# Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
The most obvious answer to this question is scrum. I know the basics from previous courses but have never used it myself as a tool for project management.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think this can be achieved simply by talking about things (such as scrum) within the group. That gives everyone different perspectives, and I think we learn a lot from each other by doing so.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not a lot (yet) - we are still getting familiar with the concept of scrum and I feel like it's a bit too early to say that we've actually started using scrum.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've been brainstorming project ideas and got the git repository and basic folder structure in place.
