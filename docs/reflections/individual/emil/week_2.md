# Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am getting more familiar with scrum but there is still a lot to learn. Writing good user stories has been a challenge - it's harder than expected to split them up so that they fulfill the INVEST-criterias. I'm also learning React seeing as that's what we have decided to use for our project. 
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've had a programming project in another course previously and that has given me some experience in regards to setting up a dev enviroment, designing in Figma etc that others might not have already - so I think I can help with that.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been managing the Trello board and been writing user stories, acceptance criteras etc as well as planning for the upcoming sprint.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We've mostly been discussing features for the project, which led to the product description we submitted.
