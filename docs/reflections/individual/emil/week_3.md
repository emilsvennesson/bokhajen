# Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I'm still getting familiar with TypeScript and React, and there is quite a lot to learn there before I feel comfortable that I'm using it the way it was intended. We've also decided to use Material UI - a framework for React that I've never used so that's on my to do list as well. I'm also still not sure whether the user stories we wrote are "good enough" or if we will have do refactor them at a later stage.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've watched quite a lot of tutorials on React these last couple of weeks so I'm hopefully able to assist/help the others out that never used React before.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have worked on the user story that was assigned to me, as well as taking part in the meetings where we discussed estimates on velocity and effort on the different user stories.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've completed the user story that was assigned to me, which turned out as a Node.js module that we're going to use in the React app to get books from the Chalmers store.
