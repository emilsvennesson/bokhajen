# Week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Some of the backend, which I haven't been very involved in writing, is still a bit confusing I must say, espacially firebase, so I would like to atleast understand better than I do know, even if I don't necessarily feel the need to learn all of it.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Honesly, the same as last week. Don't know what else to say.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week my frontend knowledge has come in handy, as I have been able to help one of my teammates with frontend code. I have also gotten help with some backend and I now understand it better. I think this exchange of knowledge between us as helped both of us develop and understand our code better. I, along with a few others, went thorugh the entire scrumboard and looked at some old user stories in the backlog that were redudant, so our scrumboard is now more up to date and clean. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
During one of meetings I was actively part of deciding our MVP. Other than that I have been working on displaying ads for books.
