# Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Learning React and Typescript to the point where I feel fairly comfortable with it, feels like a priority for me right now. I feel like I'm going to have a hard time
otherwise, both in writing code myself, as well as helping and reviewing other groupmembers. We are still early in the project and still don't feel like I have
learned the INVEST and SMART enough, so that is also on my learning list, just as it was last week.
  
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There's still a lot that's new to all of us, and by being curious and by spending some time on learning something new, e.g. a library we want to use,
I can then help me teammates. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
During this week I have been working on my assigned user story for the most part. I have also been a sounding board for the other groupmembers,
discussing how to best implement something or what we should postpone for now. I also contributed in the discussion and the decisions regarding
velocity and effort. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As I said before I have mostly been working on my assigned user story, but apart from that I have also contributed to the Team reflection.
