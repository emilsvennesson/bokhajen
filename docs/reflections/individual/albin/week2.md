# Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have decided to use React for our project, which is new to me, but I'm eager to learn. There's also much left learn when it comes to Scrum, how to 
fulfill INVEST-criterias and SMART-criterias for example.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Our designteam are all pretty new to figma, and designing interfaces in general, which I can help out with if necessary. I am quite comfortable with design, 
so I can help out with that if needed, and in that way help out the entire team.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have together with 2 others been in charge of our scrumboard, and we have focused on writing user stories, acceptance criteria, etc. This has been my biggest
contribution to Scrum this week. Apart from that I have also been involved in discussions regarding the first sprint which is coming up soon, 
and how we should approach that in the best way possible.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week has for the most part consisted of discussing potential features of our project, which I have been involved in, this has then turned in to the 
projectdescription.
