# Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Scrum, is the first thing that comes to mind. We have only just scratched the surface of scrum in previous courses and I feel like it is something that is really handy
to know, so I look forward to learning scrum.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I believe that I am fairly good at explaining something I understand myself, so to help someone or the entire team to learn something it would require me to 
understand it. So I am going to do my best at reasearching and understanding whatever the subject so I can help my teammates understand as well.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This early on my contribution has been little none. We have mostly gotten to know eachother and brainstormed ideas this first week. I have set up our scrumboard on
trello though, and I think that would have to count as my biggest contribution to date.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been a part of brainstorming ideas and discussing how feasible some ideas are. This has taken up most my time this week, but I have as I mentioned in the
question above also set up the teams scrumboard on trello.
