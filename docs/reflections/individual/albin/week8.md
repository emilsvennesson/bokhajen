# Week 8

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
This feels redundant considering it's the final week. But if it weren't the final week I would've liked to learn how to write better frontend code, because now I have learned how to write frontend in react, but perhaps not by following conventions very well.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This feels redundant considering it's the final week. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As previously I have been attending meetings, were we've discussed velocity, reviewed our sprint etc. We have also discussed our mvp and made sure that it's finished for the final presentation. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I've worked on my user stories and bug fixes, which we're some fixes as well as some new features. I have tried to include bugfixes in user stories that also adds new functionality.
