# Week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like many of our problems we've faced so far, has come from mistakes in our user stories and tasks. So with that in mind I want learn that better. I have of course learned a lot about it during the course, but I feel like the best way to really learn it is to actually do it in practice, so I have to do that even more. Other than that I also want to understand some more technical stuff, such as firebase, better than I do now.
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have been working on frontend for the most part and I am becoming more and more comfortable with react and material ui (a library we're using). Because of that I am more comfortable with frontend coding in react, which can be a bit of headache sometimes, than some other team members. So I will try to use that knowledge to help the team members with less frontend experience.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have taken part in the team's spring review and reflection. I am getting more used to working with SCRUM, but it is quite a big change from how I worked in previous projects. I have been keeping the scrumboard up to date while I've been working on my assigned user story.
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been working on displaying book ads this past week. I've had to focus a bit more on the other course I'm currently reading, which have lead to my contribution this week being smaller than previuos weeks, this was something the team was aware of though.
