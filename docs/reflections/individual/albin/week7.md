# Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
As we are getting closer to end, my focus will not be on learning new things, but instead fixing issues, bugs and adding small features before the demo. In doing so I might learn, or understand, something along the way, but it will not be my primary focus this upcoming sprint.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We're getting very close to end of this course now, and focus this sprint will be more to fix bugs and small issues in the code, more than learning new stuff. So I might not contribute very much to someone learning something new, but insteand helping the entire team in getting our product the way we want it before the demo.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As previously I have been attending meetings, were we'ev discussed velocity, reviewed our sprint etc. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This sprint I've worked on my user stories, which we're displaying contact information, as well as some minor updates to the detailview.
