# Week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
For me it is pretty much the same as last week, so React and Typescript, even though I feel fairly comfortable with Typescript now. I'm starting to get a better grip
of SCRUM and agile, but I want get even better at actually using in it practice. In recent weeks I have discovered that our task breakdown we did in the earlier stages
of the project were quite bad. So that is something I want to do better and I feel like we all are better at both creating user stories and task breakdown now than we
were before.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As I said in previous question the tasks we wrote earlier were quite bad, and even though I have noticed, I'm not sure everyone has. So by giving constructive feedback
on both user stories and tasks, I think we all can get better and more effective at writing user stories and tasks.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Other than working on my assigned user story, I have been active during our meetings, both the sprint review and the sprint reflection. I do find it hard sometimes
to grasp how I could more here, even though I definately feel like I could. I think it comes down to my understanding of SCRUM and I feel like I need to dig down
deeper in to SCRUM and agile in general in order to contribute more on this specific point. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been working mostly on frontend, for example the cards displaying all books on our website.
