# Week 2 Daniel

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get a better understanding of how the graphic design process and the development process can work together in a good way that does not make the project stand still

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can use the knowledge that i have learnt during the designing interface course to develop the graphical interface of the app in a way that makes sense. In addition, i will use my prior experience of working in a 
group to create an inviting environment and handle conflicts

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have designed and evaluated user stories that will help create a better workflow, i have also been discussing the process of evaluating the velocity with the team

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have created a small markup for the interface design in order to give everyone in the team a better picture of what the project scope contains.
I have also created a small domain model and we have discussed in the group and created a good domain description
