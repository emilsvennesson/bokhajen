## What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to further develop my skills as a recat developer and be more efficient coding. I want to be better at designing and coding for a responsive layout.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I have been sitting and working a lot with To and helping her with merging and handling a github project in a professional manner.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have helped out my fellow coders with writing some issues that have come up so that we can turn them into user stories and fix them in a later sprint.
I will make sure to have a lookout on the crumboard and see if anybody is a bit behind and help them if needed.
