## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to develop and extend my knowledge of scrum, and i also want to extend my knowledge on how to be more agile while creating a product

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we are thinking about creating our product using the React framework which I have some prior knowledge with. Therefore i can use that knowledge to teach and give the project a head start


## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since we are just starting out, i have limited knowledge of how scrum works and to which extent i can contribute to the process

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Since the project has not started my contribution has been limited to basic planning
