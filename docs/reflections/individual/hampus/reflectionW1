Week 1
What do I want to learn or understand better?

I would like to understand/learn scrum better. First learn the basics, then learn to implement the methodology. Of course learning by doing, understanding the usual mishaps concering scrum and sprints.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

When understanding scrum, the goal is for everyone in the group being on the same level of understanding. If I can I will help my group members understand the process of scrum better. Directing my group members to good sources concering scrum, if I find them.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Not that much contribution towards the use of scrum. Mostly trying to understand it. Discussing what scrum is, helping with the social contract and refining the Trello-board

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

The first week mostly discussing scrum and the project ahead. Discussing different ideas for the project. Also brainstorming about my ideas and how to present them to the team.
