# Week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this has been the last sprint I feel like I've got a good grasp on most of the things we've used, but since we didn't create our own API I would like to learn more about that.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not sure what else to say at this point, think I've said most, and done most of the things I've said previously.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participating in meetings and contributing to the scrum board have really been the only thing this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Doing a few user stories and also doing a few other small bug fixes here and there.
