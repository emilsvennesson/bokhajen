# Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I haven't really been able to attend lectures and what not I think I've been missing out on some key concepts within SCRUM or agile, such as INVEST criteria and SMART. To learn this I'm going to go through the course material, such as lecture slides or do some good ol' googling. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since most everyone is new to the libraries we've decided to use I think trying to learn and undestand them better would be very beneficial for me to be able to help and educate the rest of the team. Do accomplish this I would ideally watch some tutorials and perhaps read some of the documentation provided by the libraries.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Mostly been taking part in meetings by writing some things to discuss and some of my thoughts (since I wasn't able to there physically). I intend to do more by making and creating user stories, which I will be doing next week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Going through pull requests and general code improvements. I also implemented authentication with firebase which I think is quite integral to the project but not really connected to single user story.
