# Week 4

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since we've decided to use the firebase platform for authentication and database I think learning how use them properly is quite important. I intend to learn by watching some of the videos which firebase provides and read the docs.
  
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
After learning some things about firebase, such as firestore and authentication, I will try to showcase and explain my code and of course help those who come for my help, by trying to explain to the best of my ability or point them into the direction of some good documentation or videos.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I've created and completed some user stories. Taken part in meetings. I think I could do some more things here, but not really sure what, and I think this indicates that I need to learn a bit more about scrum by reading the course material.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Worked on the project, both with user stories and underlying code that isn't directly connected to a single user story, such as the backend connection with firebase.
