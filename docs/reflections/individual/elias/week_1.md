# Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

The only thing standing out right now that I would like to learn is scrum. I would like to be at a level where I am confident in all the steps in a sprint and use scrum in a meaningful way. This would require me to learn a bit more than I know and I will look at the course material and possibly some things found online.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As I'm currently not the best teacher I could probably send some material on that topic that I find useful, such as a youtube video or article. I would however like to become a bit better at explaining things and I think that requires good understanding of the topic, bit of preparation as well as some practice. This would mean I would have to really learn and understand the topic I'm a about to explain.

Another point to consider would be to motivate others to learn something new and I think trying to show the value of this new thing is a good approach. This would require me to know the value and convey that information in a good way.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

My current contribution as of right now is probably next to none. I would like to contribute more by for example making sure everyone is using trello in the right way, as in using the backlog, creating user stories and what not. This would require me to brush up and learn how this is achieved in a good way, and I will probably look at the material found on the canvas page.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

During this week, taking part in discussions has been my main contribution. I would like to contribute more but I assume this will come more natural as the project idéa is more finalized which would enable me to do some more concrete things such as programming or ER-diagrams etc. Another thing that I will be doing is trying to find and bring up points of discussion.
