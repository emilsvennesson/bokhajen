# Week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still haven't had the need to create firestore queries this week but I assume that I will probably have to do that next week. I have a somewhat basic understanding of how they work but I haven't written one myself yet. So I would like to write some of them myself, understand them more thoroughly. To do this, I'll probably be reading the relevant documentation and watching some relevant videos.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not sure what else to say at this point, think I've said most, and done most of the things I've said previously.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participating in meetings and contributing to the scrum board have really been the only thing this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Put quite some time this week, completing user stories and also helping my fellow teammates. I mainly put my time into being able to search for books both visual and technical parts. I also completed some of the user stories I didn't 100% complete last week.
