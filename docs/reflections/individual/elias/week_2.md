# Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since I haven't been that involved in the creation of user stories and breaking things into tasks and what not, I would like to get a better understanding of that. In other words I would like to understand how you should break user stories into tasks, how you should create acceptance criterias and such. This would require me to of course look at and understand what my teammates have done as well as read some of the material provided by the course.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since we've decided to use reactjs as part of our front-end I believe I could help my teammembers with understanding this library. I will attempt this by both explaining it myself but also providing them with some other materials that I myself found useful.
I also have experience with typescript which is what we'll use so I hope I can help my teammembers in that regard as well.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

My main contribution this week has been to create a definition of done.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I've mostly brought up some points to discuss during the meetings but other than that I've worked on a definition of done. I believe I will be able to do more as the sprints begin since that will be a more individual workflow and I'm currently working remotely.
