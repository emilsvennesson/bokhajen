# Week 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I haven't been able to do much this week I've not had the chance to experience something new that I feel like I could improve upon. However, firebase & firstore is still on my todo list on what I would like to understand better. I would like to get to a level where I can make some simple firestore queries and to a level that is required in our project. What that is, I'm not totally sure, but I'm sure I'm going to have to read a bit of documentation and perhaps watch some videos.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we've been sitting together more and more I've realized it's very easy to just go to that person that needs help and help them by writing and explaining whatever it is. However, more tricky concepts or concepts that I don't fully understand I usually just send them a link to some related material and hope they think it makes sense that way.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participating in meetings and contributing to the scrum board have really been the only thing this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I've been fed up with a math assignment and haven't been able to do all that much, however I've done the bulk of a couple user stories but didn't 100% finish them.
