# Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I'm beginning to be a bit more comfortable with scrum, but still have a lot to learn before I can comfortably use it. I want to understand better the workings och user stories, tasks and the INVEST & SMART criterias. I also want learn how to use figma for design and to understand more about react.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now I'm part of the designteam, which has not worked with design before So hopefully we will learn together and if someone needs help, I will try my best to help. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Participated in some discussions, but otherwise not much unfortunately. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week, I've contributed to the deliviries by participating in the group discussions and summarizing/writing a short preliminary description of our project.
