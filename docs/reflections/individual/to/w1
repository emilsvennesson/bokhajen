# Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn more about scrum. This first week has only been an introduction to this topic for me. It seems like a good tool to have in project management, looking forward to learn more (by doing or otherwise).
## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Hopefully we will all learn from each other as there are many different group members. As for me, I will try to learn the topic before trying to help/explain it to others. Most likely will be forwarding the materials that I've used to teach myself to other group members to spread the knowledge, if needed. 
## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
For this week, as of right now, not much. I would like to contribute more once I've learned more about it and also learn more about Trello. 
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week, my contribution has been subpar as other members has created stuff as setting up Trello, social contracts, repositories, project folder. I've been part of the brainstorming and contributed with some ideas. Onwards I will be contributing more to the deliveries as the project begins to take shape.
